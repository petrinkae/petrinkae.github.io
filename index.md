I'm a data & graphics reporter on [Chalkbeat](https://chalkbeat.org/)'s [data visuals](https://dataviz.chalkbeat.org/) team. Check out my [recent bylines](https://www.chalkbeat.org/authors/kae-petrin) and my [broader portfolio](https://authory.com/KaePetrin). I occasionally write blogs and freelance reviews about [queer sci-fi and fantasy media](https://stetting.writeas.com).

Previously, as a digital reporter at [St. Louis Public Radio](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/people/kae-m-petrin), I created graphics, built newsroom-wide tools, and covered data-driven stories across beats. Before that, I was an editorial assistant at [St. Louis Magazine](https://www.stlmag.com/topics/kae-m-petrin/). I also produced freelance investigations, breaking news, webÂ redesigns, and entertainment criticism, and spent a year in healthcare as a data analyst.

In 2020, I co-founded the [Trans Journalists Association](https://transjournalists.org/) with a collective of transgender and nonbinary media-makers; I also serve as a secretary for the [St. Louis Pro chapter](http://www.stlspj.com/about/) of the Society of Professional Journalists.
