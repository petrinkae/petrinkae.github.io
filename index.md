I'm a data & graphics reporter on [Chalkbeat](https://chalkbeat.org/)'s [data visuals](https://dataviz.chalkbeat.org/) team, where I collaborate with local reporters to tell data-driven stories about education. Occasionally I work with [Votebeat](https://www.votebeat.org/), as well. Check out my [recent Chalkbeat bylines](https://www.chalkbeat.org/authors/kae-petrin) and my [broader portfolio](https://authory.com/KaePetrin). I also do part-time, project-based data analysis and viz for the [Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk](https://agwaterdesk.org/).

In 2020, I cofounded the [Trans Journalists Association](https://transjournalists.org/) with several dozen other journalists; I have since run many of its internal operations and served as an interim board member to oversee the association's nonprofit corporation. I present on queer and trans coverage best practices, data reporting and visualization tools, and the intersections of these topics at universities, industry conferences, custom-designed workshops, and newsrooms around the U.S. I also serve as a secretary for the [St. Louis Pro chapter](http://www.stlspj.com/about/) of the Society of Professional Journalists. 

Previously, as a digital reporter at [St. Louis Public Radio](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/people/kae-m-petrin), I created graphics, built newsroom-wide tools, and covered data-driven stories across beats. Before that, I was an editorial assistant at [St. Louis Magazine](https://www.stlmag.com/topics/kae-m-petrin/). While working in Missouri and Illinois, I also produced freelance investigations, breaking news, web redesigns, and entertainment criticism, and spent a year in healthcare as a data analyst.
